## Remixing

Allowing remixing means that others can download, edit, change, and re-publish your Spoke scene as long as they give credit to the creators of the scene. If you allow allow remixing, you agree to license your scene under a [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode) license. We’ll provide you an opportunity to include the attribution information you want to include. This information will be associated with the scene, but not stored with your account.

You can change this setting at any time, by re-publishing your scene.

If you don't allow remixing, your content will be published under the Hubs and Spoke [Terms of Service](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/hubs/).
